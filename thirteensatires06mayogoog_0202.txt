perpetuisne malis voluptatibus perfruens in ea quam saepe usurpabas,
tranquillitate ἄρρενι omnem aetatem sine dolore ....... an cum de omnibus
gentibus optime mererere, ...... vel Herculis pati aerumnas? sic

virtus sit resque magnae et summe laudabiles virtute metae, ibi esse
miseria et aerumna non possit, tamen labor possit, possit molestia·

oend0, sed vindicando. cf. the famous myth of Ptodicus (Xen. mem.
11 1 5 21. Cic. off. 15118 Beier). Hercules is distinctly called a phi·
losopher. Max. Tyr. 21 5 6 Herakles was wise‚· yet not for himself
wise, but his wisdom extended over every land and sea. It was he that
was the exterminator of beasts of prey, chastiser of tyrants‚ liberator of
slaves, legislator of the free, establisher of righteousness‚ inventor of
laws, truthful in words, reformet in deeds. But if Herakles had chosen

wisdom‚ he would have been instead of Herakles a sophist, and no one
would have dated to call him son of Zeus. ib. 3 5 7. 5 5 8. 31 5 7. 38 5 7 011
