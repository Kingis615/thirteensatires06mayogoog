palmata was so called from the palm-branchos which, with Victories and
other figures, were worked upon it. There were two kinds oi embroidery
used in Rome, the Phrygian in eroes-stitch, the work of phrygiones,-
the Babylonian in satin-stitch arc plumaria, the work of plumarii: the
former corresponds to engraving by dots, ‘ stippling‚’ the latter to line
engraving.'1'he tunica palmata was χρυσοποίκιλτος or χρυσοτοίκιλος
(DS. xv111 26 §4- Athen. 1980), a work oi the ars plumaria,· the toga
picta was spangled with stare, χρυσόπαστος, a work of the phryg] iones.
App. Pun. 66 Scipio in his triumph wore purple with gold stars 'worked
on it. Nero entered Rome after his Grecian victorias in the triumphal
car of Augustae, wearing (Suet. 25) a chlamys distincta stellis aureis
(DGass. Lxm 20 §3 calls it ἁλουργίδα χρυσόπαστον, which is the very
term applied by Plut. Aemil. Paul. 34 §5 to the triumphal robe). On
the Greek vases found in Etruria the embroidery consiste oi stars,
crosse8‚ dots and round ornaments surrounded with dota, which were often
formed of little spangles and leaves of gold; these spangles‚ the remains
of the funeral rubea, have been found in graves both in Etruria. and 111

consul, and thenit was the same which other praetore and consuls assumed

Roman who had a palmata tunica and toqa picta of his own when out of
office; whereas up to that time imperatores vel de Capitolio acciperent;
