(cir. B. 0. 130-1-63, the year of Cicero’s consulship) in Mommsen's his- '2
tory. If he shared with Priam etc. the sorrow of lesing wife, brother, ·'

proper, where his forces held out at Athens against Sulla, 11. o. 86, 0110 01 ·

encountered Q. Oppius, L. Cassius, Μ’. Aquilius, Sulla, Fimbria, Murena,

accession to the throne 01 Lydia, he added largely to his dominions by
conquest (Hdt. 1 26—8): many Greeks famed for wisdom came-to Sardis,
