Tun Egyptians, who woulld dcem it sacrilege to taste an onion or a·
leek, have in our enhghtened times been guilty of barbarity which equale
that oi the monsters of table (1—32). A festival at Ombi was lately
inter-rupted by the Temyritesi one of whom, after his party had been put
to ssight, was overtaken, torn in pieces and devoured (33-92). Other
natione are said to have fed on the flesh of man, but only when driven to
it by famine: rage and hate move the Egyptians to crimes which othere
only commit in the madness of despair (93—1312). Man is made for
society and sympathy ; yet man has been known to do what brute beasts
will not do, to prey upon his own kind (131-174).

The poet seems to have been led to ‹choose this subject partly by the
hatred and contempt which Romans, after the battle of Actium, enter-
tained ior the Egyptians (cf. 1 26. 130. 1v 24. Aen. v111 685—713. Hor.

of their manners 45 quautwm ipse nota-vis).

With the who e satire compare [Quintil] decl. 111 ‘pasti cadaveris'
(verses 20, 102, 122, with the notes).
