x* · Anvnnnsnnmr ’

'In my notes 1 have endeavoured at once to meet the
wants of English studente (in general little accustomed
to consult original authorities and debarred from the
best and latest books of reference) and also to supply
new materials for the grammarian, lexicographer and
historian². Following the steps of casaubon and Gataker,
Scaliger and Hemsterhuis, I have drawn materials from
writers, accessible to me, of every race and creed. I see
only a riddle in , the taste‚ which, allowing LibaniuS, lays
Chrysostom under ban ; scouring the world fo‘r an inscrip-
tion, while blind to a vast literature ready to hand. Were
Philo a pagan, his historical tracts would assuredly rank
as priceless evidence respecting the early empire. Even
lexicography has suffered by the stigma cast on men, who ,
had served many philosophies before they bowed their

, necks beneath the cross; for it might then be said, fiunt,

non nascuntur Christiani.
I have purposely abstained from consulting any English
edition of Juvenal.

Sr Jonu's, Sept. 9, 1878.

⁵ 1 I know not why Mr A. Palmer (Hermathena 1 391) should suppose

'that Ov. m. v111 283 had ‘escaped my notice ’. It is printed at length, in
both editione, in the note on 1v 27, and this note is cited on v 147, the

verse which Mr Palmer is discussing; see too Dobree advers. 11 387.
The other quotation should be not ‘met. x. 38. v. 1’ but v 381, which,
with this correction, 1 gratefully accept. If Μι- Palmer will consult the
ind. under sed, he will see other authorities. He does not observo that
Ribbeck corrupte both lines by the same cheap nostrum, nec for sed (lv 27
nec maioris se). Bergk’s warning (speaking of the Teubner Gellius J ahi-bb.
01111 1876 27 6) is certainly opportune: ‘wenn dies so fort geht, so witti,
ohe nochmals dreissig iahre verflossen sind, jeder mann von bildung und
geschmack sich mit widerwillen von den in Deutschland erschienen neuen
ausgaben lateinischer schriitsteller abwenden.'
