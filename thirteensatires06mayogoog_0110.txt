54--5 For what then must we pray 7 [⁴ Erao begins a new paragraph,
as it so often does with an interrogative, or an imperative; in coming
back from a digression. Iuvenal may have mitten: erqo supervacua aut
ut perniciosa petuntur, propter quae sas est genua incerare deorum 1 that
is, erqo, ut supervacua aut perniciosa inceratis genibus deorum petuntur,
ita quae vere utilia et pia hoe modo petuntur? “Well then to come back
to our subject, even as superfluous or hurtful things are, as we have seen,
asked for in prayer, what things may we with propriety ask for ?” Then
he goes on to put cases: then 103 er go qaid optandum—Seianum, as if
with reference to our erqo. Then he *goes on to other eases3 and then ,
346 Nil ergo optabunt ete„ as if again with reference to our erqo. The
ut merely repeating the letters os aut is a very easy emendation. The
· omission oi ita in the apodosis is very eommon in poen-y, and even in

prose. I had first thought of another emendation: haut 1 find irom J ahn’s
index oeeurs eight times in Iuvenalt in three of the eight places P has
aut, ablunder eommon of course in all MSS. :v in seven os the eight places
too 1 think haut is joined with an adjective, as swror haut dubius. I thought
then of reading erqo supervacua haut, haut perniciosa petuntur, Ι propter
eto. with a question: ‘⁴ Are then the things asked for in prayer not super·
flaons, not pernicieus, things ior which we may with propriety petition
the gods?”' H.A. J.M.] 54 sarzanam aur mammosa
