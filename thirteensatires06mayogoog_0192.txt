Endymion, Ιιίσ catamitus meus. Endymion is a patronymic from
ἔνδυμος, and that from ἐνδὺως 1. e. according to some, Endymion 1s a per-
sonification oi sleep, and the name denotes the stealthy approaches of
elumbem according 1ο Welcker Gotterl. 1 557—-9 it denotes the visit ο1
the goddess, her entrance into Endymion' s cavern3 the lingering of her
rays on the grey rocks of Latmos, as it stands out· ιιι sharp outline against
the blue sky became in the legend the parting kiss with which she re-
luctantly tcars herself from her Endymion. The image oi the setting
moon, when Selene was changed into the coy Artemis, became a hand-
some huntsman resting in the cavern, οι a shepherd of the hille. He
who is wedded to a goddess cannot live, and so Endymion sleeps in
his adyton on mt. Latmos in Karia (Paus. v l ξ 4 =·5) a sleep that
knows no waking (Welcker). The Eleians also laid claim to Endymion
and shewed his tomb (Paus. ib.‚) as did the Karians in a cave near the
river Latmos Strab. p. 636. Hes. s. v, Sleep appears by his side in many
sarcophagi and pictures (described by Ο. Jahn ιιι-0111101. Beitr. 51-

165--9 has collected the jests to which the story gave rise.P1ut. Num.4
fi 3 has some interesting remarks on legende like this, comparing that of
Egeria etc. John Fletcher the faithful shepherdess 1 3 (11 38—9 Dyce)
tells the ‘tale of love’ well: ‘how the pale Phoebe, hunting in a grove, Ι

““ first saw the boy Endymion, from whose eyes Ι she took eternal fire that
