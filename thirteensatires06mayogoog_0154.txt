to vie with Xerxes, who had won admiration by flooring the narrower
Hellespont; but Suetonius' grandfather heard from courtiers the real
motive: ThrasyUus the astrologer had declared to Tiberius that Gaius
would no more reign than he would ride on horseback over the bay of

the Corinthian Isthmus, had the examples of Darius and Xerxes before

Demetrios oi Skepsis in Strab. vu fr. 35 held that the canal could never ς

have been completed, so as to be navigable its whole length, owing to the
difficulties of a part of the ground. But travellers, as ‚Choiseul-Gouffier‚

Walpole, Leake‚ have found remains of it, and licut. Wolfe, who sur- ξ
veyed it, says (penny cyclop. Athos. class. mus. 1 84): ‘ 'I'he canal of '

Xerxes is still most distinctly to be traced across the isthmus, from the
guli of Monte Santo to the bay of Erso in the guli of Contessa, with the
exception of about 200 yds. in the middle, where the ground bears no
appearance of ever having been touched . . . . It is probable that the
central part was afterwards filled up, in order to allow a more reffly
passage into and out of the peninsula . . . . The distance across is 2500
yde„ which agrees very well with the breadth of 12 stadia assigned by
Hdt. The width of the canal appears to have been about 18 or som
the level of the earth nowhere exceeds 15 ft. above the sea; the soil is a
light clay.' cf. Grote, ed. 1862, 111 378-9 and Leake northern Greece 111
