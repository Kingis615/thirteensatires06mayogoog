-invitee hie friend Persicus to e. frugal dinner.
Τιι rich epicure ie edmired3 the poor, derided: om· housekeeping and
our whole plan of life should be in inst proper-tion to our meane (1—38).
Many, it is true, neglect this golden rule; they riot for a while at Rome,
and then retire to Baiae, to avoid their creditore ‚ms—55). ⁷

To-day‚ my friend, you may judge whether I practise the frugality
which I preach3 whether 1 live like the worthies of those good old times
when heaven itself guarded our city (56-119)‚ or, like their pampered
descendente, cen relieh no moal but euch as ie ser-ved on the coetliest
tames, „by the most expett and elegant eleves (mo-461). Let richer
men enliven their feaets by voluptuous eonge and danaes: here you may
lieten, is you will, to Homer or his rival Vix-gil (162-182).

Leeve then all care behind you3 leave to younger men the dissipationi
of the Circae, and epend the festival with me in enjoymente better suited
to om· years (183-208).

Whether Persicus is a real or fictitious character does not appean itis
not certain that Iuvenal would have hesiteted to address a living friend
in ench verses as 186 seq.
