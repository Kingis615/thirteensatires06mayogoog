ib. 14 his relatione, friends, fiatterers, and those who had moved the
senate to vote him honours, were put on their tria13 some who had been
acquitted were again tried, on the ground that they owed their escape to
his favour; the mere fact that one had been a friend 01 S. stood in lieu 01
all proof 01 guilt3 his own creatures endeavoured to screen themselves by ·
acousing others. ib. 15 ἓξ 1-3 most 01 1110 accused committed suicide.
Senators and knights and ladies were crowded into the carcer, and either

guilty and innocent suffered alike. Once Tiberius declared that any one
was free to mourn 101· S.; but shortly afterwards the executione were

ι resumed. ib. 19 some friends 01 S. were spared, as L. Seianus the praetor
2 and M. Terentius a knight, who boldly avowed his iriendship 101· the

fallen favorite‚ and defended it by the example 01 Tiberius. ib. 25 ἓξ 2-

condemnation by suicide.

82 meru ner mancum Quintil. 1 5 ἕ 46 tells us that some regarded
such a contradictio in adiecto (the epithet ‘great’ with a diminutive) as a
solecism vitium, quod fit per quantitatem, ut magnum peculiolum,
erunt qui soloecismum putent, quia pro nomine inteqro positum sit demi-
nutum. Apul. mag. 74 calls a false accuser totius calumniae fornacula.
The form forn. is also used by Vitruvius and Fronto; diminutives began
to be affected in the silver age, and have passed in great numbers into the
Romanc‘e languages ver. 173 n. The metaphor lay very near cf. ver. 61 seq.
In such a devouring turnaco perished the friends 01 Livia (Suet. Tib. 51),
Agrippina (Tac. an. 1v 52) and Germanicus (ib. 683 see esp. 69 fin. for
the universal terror). So Gaius (Caligula) prosecuted many on the score
01 friendship 101· his former victims (DCass. mx 23 ξ 8); 1110 case 01110-
pidae, his brother-in-law and intended successor (ib. 22 §g 6—9) is an
exact parallel to this 01 S.; the soldiers received a donative as for a
victory, and three swords were dedicated by the emperor to Mars Ultor.
