lowest of the people; and some 01 them played the flute and danced,

horses, and slew wild beasts, and fought in single combat (inf. 199 seq.)‚

vnnnxnr etc. [⁴‘Madvig has well pointed out how confused and sels-

.contradictory the explanatione 01 the older editors are: much that he

says is manifestly true; but I am not at all satisfied with his own expla-
nation 01 the most difficult point, quanti sua sunera etc.: funem, as he
takes it, even if Latin which Ι doubt, could not have been intelligible
with the context to a Latin reader; and in my opinion his interpreta-
tion weakem, if it does not destroy, the point of the contr-ast between
these words, and Finge tamen yladios cet. with which they were evi-
dently intended to contrast. Juvenal here, as in other places, referring
to an age long past, that 01 Nero, in his rhetorical way, as 11 it were
present, and indeed mentally thinking 01 it as present, is necessarily
obscure. In describing- too this Res memoranda novis annalibus atque
recenti Historia Ι believe he had Tacitus annal. nv 14 etc. before him,
and perhaps some other 01 the authorities 01 Dio quoted by you: 188
189 1011. seems almost to refer to Tacitus: mox ultro vocari populus
Romanus laudibusque extollere, ut est vulqus cupiens voluptatum...nobi·
lium familiarum posteros eyestate venales in scenam deduxit cet. Ι

⁴ cannot understand why Madvig should deny that funera vendere for
, vitam vendere is Latin, the two ideas being interchangeable and the
ί Latius often thus using mors. redimere aliquid vita and the like are
τ common in Cicero: see Nizolius and Freund: but then Caesar bel. Gall.

1 44 12 says omnium yentium atque amicitiam eius morte redimere
posset: Ovid ex Ponto 111 1 105 Si mea mors redimenda tua...esset.· i.e.

ἰ si venderes tuam mortem ut meam redimeres. Wen then Juvenal says
- ⁴ At what price these creatures sell their deaths, what matter θ’ (Ι omit
f 101· the moment 193 vendunt—ludis). Sume tamen yladios cet. ‘ yet 11 the
ἱ, choico were given them ‘⁴ will you go on the stage or be killed ?” Ι should
- have thought that none would have hesitated 101· a moment to choose
· death, rather than be zelotypus etc. :’ thus you get a direct contr-ast

between quanti ε. s. v.‚ and Sume rma ⁴‹yladios etc. which is surely

iintended. Juvenal in his indignation does not choose to distinguish

{between their actual degradation and what he thinks they ought to feel:
zthen 198 1011. Res haut mira cet. seems still a reminiscence 01 Tacitus:

l. c. 15 non nobilitas cuiquam (cith. princ. mimus Nobilis) non aetas
