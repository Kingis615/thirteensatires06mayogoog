Mun pray for eloquence‚ strength, wealth, and thus invite their own ruin
upon themselves (1—27). well might Democritus and Heraclitus in
this vanity oi human wishes find matter, the one for laughter, the
other for tears (28-53). For what may we pray (54—5)? Vaulting
ambition o'erleaps itselfz witness Seianus, Crassus, Pompeius, Caesar

 

(56—113). The schoolboy envies the eloquence of Demosthenes and.

ι Cicero; yet it had been well for Gicem, if he had only been known
as the meanest of poets: for DemostheneS, if he had never left his

1 father’s smithy (114- 132). How passing is military glory, and how

· uncertain military power, appears in Hannibal and Xerxes3 Alexander,

1 for whom the world was all too strait, found rest at last in an urn

, (133—187). Length oi days does but bring decay of body and mind.
Peleus and Nestor, had they died early, would not have mourned the
loss oi Achilles and of Antilochus. Priam, Hecuba, Croesus, Mithri-
dates, Marius, Pompeius were spared to their own hurt (188—288).
Beauty is dangerous even to the chaste; example of Silius (289—345).
Leave to the gods, who know what is best for you¹ to order your lot as
they will: pray only for health of mind and body, that you may
bravely bear the worst (346—365).
