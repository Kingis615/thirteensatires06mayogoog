Orelli 1502, 1503 cmm ursano, “vestigia hic mihi videor invenire
Caelicolarum, de quibus cod. Theodos. ΧΠ 8 ἕ 19 consulendus.” The

quotes cod. Bezae acts 13 50. 17 4, where σεβόμενοι is rendered caelicolae
(cf. Ronsch Itala und Vulg. 306); adding: in post-biblical J ewish writings
the name os God, except in prayers, is scrupulously avoided. One of
the commoneat substitutos is ‘heaven’ (John 3 27) 3 so ‘the kingdom os
heaven’=‘the kingdom os Orod) The God-fearing proselyto, the jere
adonai oi the bible, in post-biblical language becomes heaven-fearing

‘those are they that sear heaven! Midrasch on deut. (Debarim Babba
c. 2=Salkut ps. 47 10) tells how a Roman senator ‘searing heaven‚'
aver-ted a persecution of the Jews by the sacrifice of his life. Another.
ex. in J elh’nek Bet hidramasch 5 p. var. This usage led Iuv. and others
to attribute to the Jews the worship of heaven; ‘nubes is a satiric touch,
to throw into relies the nebulone nature of such a God of heaven as
opposed to the sharply defined outlines of the gods of Greece and Rome
(cf. Aristoph. nub. 365—425). The term proves that Iuv. does not intend
to charge the Jews with an idolatrous worship of heaven 3 such a calumny
was no longer possible, even for the most malicious, as is shewn by
Tacitns’ aeknowledgement of the purity of the J ewish conception of God,
Go‘ser adds ‘the god. of heaven ’ Ezra 1 2. 7 12 21 cet. also Matt. 21 25.
