seen? . . . more slaves than you can recollect Υ See the whole treatise
and ep. 87 on the true riches. In his consolation addressed to his mother
Helvia 143 3 he says that she always rejoiced in her sons‘ wealth, but
never drew upon it. Α. n. 55 some blamed Seneca and Burrus, viros yra-
vitatem adseverantes, for dividing houses and country mansions among
them as so much booty Tac. 1111 18. Α. n. 58 P. Suillius asked (Tac. 1111
- 42) ‘by what philosophie rule Senee'a had, in four years of imperial favour,
amassed 300,000‚000 sesterces ἲ [cf. DOass. 1111 10. Τ116 fortunae of Pallas

and drained Italy and the provinces [e. g. Britain DCasS. mm 2] by exor-
- bitant usury.’ A.1>. 62 Seneca was accused (Tac. xrv 52) of still adding to

. wealth already exceeding a private standard, of ambitious designs, and oi

outdoing the emperor himself in the splendour of his parks and country
houses, hortorum anroenitate et villarum magnificentia. Sen. to Nero
(ib. 53): ‘ You have heaped upon me such an abundance of offices and
wealth‚ that nothing is wanting to my good fortune but to moderate it. . . .
You have surrounded me with boundless treasureS, so that 1 often
ask myself, Do I, a man of equestrian and provincial family, take rank
with the noblest of the realm? . . . where is that spirit satisfied ‘avith a
modest fortune 2 does it lay out such parke as these, tales hortos extruit,
and stalle throuyh these subm-ban estates, and run riot in so vast temtor-ies,
such boundless revenues ‚² The only excuse that presente itself is (cf. Seu.

excel all the world in forttme, as you do in worth) In short he refused
to relieve Seneca of his wealth (c. 56. Suet, Nero 35); who however
changed his course of lire, holding no more levees‚ and keeping close
within deors. A. D. 62 (Tac. x1v 65) 116 was suspected of treasonable cor-
respondence with Piso, After the fire of Rome, A. 1). 64, 116 made over his
riches to Nem, as a contribution to the expenses of rebuilding the city
(DOass. mm 25 ξξ 3). 17 sennem non-ros musn-

· derate of Piso’s (Tac. xv 56, 60): a tribune invested, globis militum

Seneca’s nephew‚ Lucan, also the owner of horti marmorei (Iuv. v11
79—80) engaged in the conspiracy from personal pique, Nero having
disparaged his poems (Tac. xv 49); he denouneed his own mother (ib.
56), but did not thereby escape death (ib. 70). Mela, Lucan’s father,
while endeavour-ing to secure his son’s property, was accused on the

“ strength of a forged correspondence, which Ner0, opibus eius inhians
‚ (Tac. XVI 17), professed to receive as genuine. He too, like his brother

and sister-in-law and son, bled himself to death. On horti see 1 75 n.
