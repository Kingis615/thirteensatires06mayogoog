Memnon in the Aethiopis of Arctinus, one of the poems which formed
the epic cyclo, was described as son of Aurora and Tithonus, who was
slain by Achilles before Troy. and afterwards received the gift of im·
mortality. By the Alexandriae writers this legend was connected with
the statue of the Egyptian king Amunoph 111. Pausan. 1 42 ξ 2 (ἀλλὰ
γὰρ οὐ Μέμνονα οὶ Θηβαῖοι λέγουσι, Φαμένωφα δὲ εἶναι τῶν ἐγχωρίων,
οὗ τοῦτο τὸ ἄγαλμα ἥν. 01. CIG 4727 ἔκλυον αὐδήσαντος ἐγὼ ’πὺ λίθω
Βάλβιλλα Ι φώνας τᾶς θείας Μέμνονος ἢ Φαμένωθ. ib. 4731). The first
writer who speaks 01 the musical sound is Strabo 816 who himself heard
it at dawn, but does not call the statue Memnon’s. He saw uc„ 24 two
colossal statues, one erect, the other broken irem its pedestal by an
earthquake (possibly that recorded by Eus. a. u. 0. 728213. 0. 26 Thebae
Aeyypti usque ad solu-m dirutae); it was from the portion oi the latter
which remained on the base that the sound (ψόφος ὡς ἂν πληγῆς οὐ
μεγάλης) was believed to proceed. He was 111010 with Aelius Gallus and
speaks with great cantion εἴτε δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς βάσεως εἴτε ἀπὸ τοῦ κολοσσοῦ
εἶν’ ἐπίτηδες τῶν κύκλῳ καὶ περὶ τὴν βάσιν ἱδρυμένων τινὸς ποιήσαντος τὸν
ψόφον, οὐκ ἔχω διισχυρίσασθαι. διὸ, γὰρ τὸ ἄδηλον τῆς αἰτίας πᾶν μᾶλλον
ἐπέρχεται πιστεύειν ἢ τὸ ἐκ τῶν λίθων οὕτω τεταγμένων ἐκπέμπεσθαι τὸν
ἦχον. Ρ1111. xxxv1 5 58 after describing the famous recumbent statue of
the Nile 01 1110 stone called basanites, adds non absimilis illi narratur
in Thebis delubro Serapis, ut putant, Memnonis statuae dicatus,
quem cotidiano solis ortu contactum radiis crepare tradunt.
Upon the statue may now be traced the names os more than a
