vmvun is the only true nobility: is you are just in word and deed, by

these features I reeoqniee you (aquom 26) ss s. noble: otherwise your p
illustrious name may but be applied in mockery, as we call a dwarf ,
an Atlas (1—38). Rubellius may boast of his ancestor Iulus: but if
he sits still as a stock, while plebeiam are miv-ely serving their
country in the law-court or the camp, he must look to be'eondemned
like the Iagging horse in the circus, whom no pedigree can save iroth
the mill or the cart (39—70). Would you know how to live as befits
your descent? Be a breve soldier, a just iudge, an honest governor,

· · as well in unwarlike Corinth ss in rude Gaul or Spain, So will high

birth be indeed an honour to you3 whereas it only brings out in
more glaring colom-s the crimes oi the oppressor or debauchee (71.-
145). So is it with Isateranus, who, though a consular, lives the life
of a vulgar sot: a. slave, who should do the same, would be sent to
work in chains in the country (146-182). Other nobles, stin more
completely lost to shame, appear on the stage. Be ie s0, that they
are well paidz what ol that? No ples, but· that of necessity, ean
palliato the offence. Nor indeed can than better were it to die,

' than to aot with Thyme10 or· corinthus (les-197). Beyond this

there is but one lower stage oi insensa—the arena: and even there
you may see a Gracchus, and see him too, as though determined to
publish abroad his shame, choose those arms which least of all hide
the wearer’s features. No wonder that the very gladiators are
ashamed of so degenerate an antagonist (198—210). None can be
οἱ nobler birth than Nem, yet he exceeded the crime oi Orestes,
