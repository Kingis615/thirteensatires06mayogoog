’ replied Tellos ol Athens, for he had begotten good sons, who hsd also

childrem snd when he died fighting 101· his country, they all survived (30).
Next ιο Tellos Solon mnked Kleobis and Biton oi Argos, who died the night
after they hsd drawn their mother, a priestess, to the temple 31). Croe-
sus being sngry with his guest ior not naming him ss the piest of
men, Solon reckons up the days in s life 0170 years, esch dsy exposed to
its own accidents3 and shews that happiness does not increase in propor-
tion to weslth : ‘ in every thing we must hsve regurd to the end, how it
will fau out at last: for God has shewn prosperity to many, whom after·
wei-ds 110 has plucked up by the roots’ (32). Croesus dismisses Solon,
thinking him very simple, blind ιο present prosperity, while he insiste on
keeping the end in view (33). Vengesnoe begins to fanon Croesus for
his pride; he dreams that his son Atys is killed by the thrust ot s spesr
(34. 387-9). The dream is inlfiUed, and Croesus spends- two yesrs in

mighty empire (46-4565 1). He invades Kappadokia (es—71. ¹73. 75);
after an indecisive engagement returning to Sardis, he is besieged by
Cyrus, who takes him prisoner, and orders him to be burnt. On the pyre,
remembering Solon’s lesson, he cslls thrice, Solon, Solon, Solon. Cyrus
enquiring the meaning oi the cry, hears the ts1e3 sesi-ing divine ven·
genneo, and remembering that his own fortune is ss uncertain ss his
captive's, he orders the fire to be quenched; which the bystsnders cannot
do, when Apelle, moved by the prayers of Croesus, sends a heavy shower
(76—87). On the proverbial wealth of Croesus see Papo-Benseler Κροῖσος.
