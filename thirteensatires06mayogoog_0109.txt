of Abderites e. g. 111 An ass spilt all the oil in the gymnasium: the
people brought all the asses in the town together, that they might take
warning by his punishment. 112- An Abderite would have hung ¹himse113
the cord breaking, he fell down and broke hishead. He went to the
surgeon, clapped a plaster on the wound and hung himself again. 120
An Abderita, hearing that leeks and onions are ⁴ windy ’ (flatulent), being
on a voyage, in a dead calm, filled a bag with them and hung it at the
stern. 122 An Abderite sold a pot without ears, Being asked why he
took off the ears, he replied: ‘ that it might not run away, on hearing
that it was to be sold.' Of. Κ. Fr. Hermann hist. of Abdera in his gesam-

1112 ξ 11 Diogenes exposed a sophist by stretchiny out the middle
finyer; and when he broke out into a fury, said: ‘ There you see the
man3 I have shewn him to you.’ It was a gesture worthy oi a cynic:
some sti-angers asking to see Demosthenes (DL. v1§ 34) Diogenes held
out his middle finyer and said ‘There you have the famous orator
oi the Atheniens.' Again (ἓ 35) 110 said that a finger made all the differ-
ence between madness and sanity with most men: hold o-ut the middle
s inq er, and they will think you mad3 but not if you hold out the index
finger. DChrys. 33 11 18 R. ‘ what would a man think of a city, where all
held out the middle sinyer in pointing, in shaking handS, in holding
up the hands, in electione, in passing sentence 2 . . . . these are the
things which have given your enemies occasion to reproach you-³ To
shoot out the middle finger from the clenched fist, in shape oi the phallus,
at a man, was to taunt him in the most injurious manner, as a pa-
thic. Hence the gr. name for this finger was καταπύγων Phot. s. v. Poll.

schol. Iuv. 11 95). Such an affront caused Chaerea to plot against Gaius
(Caligula Suet. 56). Like many obscene gestures, this was regarded as
a deience· against the evil eye, Ο. Jahn in Ber. d. siichs. Gesellsch. 17
