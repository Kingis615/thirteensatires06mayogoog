like Lueretia’s3 Verginia would 16111 take Rutila’s hnmp, giving Rutila 111

exchange her own faultless shape. Still greater dangers await the beau: ,
a blooming son keeps his parents on the rack with tear: so seldom is !
beauty mated with chastity. [⁶ chaste is no epithet to suit with fair’J. ·

Though the plain home, taking 61161· the ancient Sabines, may have
handed down 110111 sire to son spotless manners, though boon Nature may
have done her part, dealing with liberal hand chaste affectione, and a
iace flushed with modest blood (for what more can Nature bestow on a
boy, Nature mightier than every keeper and every safeguards) still the

well-favoured youth may never 116 111611; for the seducer's lavish hardi· ζ

110011 is bold to bribe the very parents to their children's sin: such trust
have they in the power of gifts. . No tyrant ever in his cruel fortress un-
manned a misshapen stripling‚ no Nero ever ravished a lad bandy-legged
or wen-throated, gorbellied at once and hnmp-backed. Go to now, and
rejoice in your spruce youth, whom greater pei-ils await: he will tum
adulterer general to the city and will fear vengeance, such as a wrathful
husband may take, nor will be a luckier gallant than Mars that he should
never be entrapped, Sometimes however that indignation takes more
licence than any law has allowed to indignation3 one stabs the paramour
to death, another draws blood with the lash; some lechers also are
clystered with the mugilis.-——But your Endymion, 1 say, will prove the
adulterer 01 6 wedded dame whom he loves; presently‚—when Servilia
6011166, money in hand,—oi one whom he loathes3 he will strip her 01 all
her bravery; 101· what sacrifice will not any matron, be she Oppia or
more profligate Catulla, make to 1161· lusts? woman's whole character has
its root there. But what harm does beauty to the chaste 7 nay, what
good had Hippolytus 01 1116 temperate resolve, or what Bellerophon?
For Stheneboea and Cretan Phaedra alike reddened as scor-ned by this
rebuff‚ both took fite, both shook 101· rage: when shame goads hate, then
it is that a woman is most 1111111666. Choose what advice you think
best 101· him whom Caesar's wife is bent on wedding in her husband’s
lifetime. The fairest at once and best 01 6 patrician house is hurried off,
to be slain poor seul by Messalina’s eyes: long since she is seated in
state, the flame-red wedding-veil is ready, the coverlet of Tyrian purple
is spread on the marriage-bed 101· 611 10 see; the million sesterces 01
dowry will 116 1116116 over in ancient form, witnesses will come to set their
6661 10 1116 contram, the auspex to declaro it blessed of heaven. Yon
thought this a secret, entrusted to 6 iew; she will not marry but in 11116
form 01 1611. Say, Silius, what is your choice. Refuse, and you are a
dead man before the lamps are 111; commit the crime, and a little respite
will be granted, till the news, stale to the city and to all subiecta, may
reach the ears of Claudius. He will be the last to learn the stain on his
home3 meanwhile do you, if a few days· life is worth the price, obey the
behest 01 Messalina: in either case, whichever event you think better and
easier, this fair white neck must be offered to the headsman’s swerd.
