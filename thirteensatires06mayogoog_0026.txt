coh. Delmatarum, and' Iearn from the diploma of Trajan in
cardinali tav. ΧΠ, and from that of Hadrian (Orelli-Henzen
5455), that the coh. 1 Delmatarum (without the addition mil-
liaria) was then in Britain, and consider that the inscriptions
of the raefectus coh. 1 Delmat. (Orelli 2716—7) were found in
Oumberland, we cannot refrain from claiming for Iuv. also the
title of a praefectus cohortis, and think we discover the sting of
Trajan's words et te Philomela promovit [vita v Jahn] chiefly in
this, that by virtue of them the poet received by the Philomela

only the lower grade of praefectus, whereas (vu 92 praefectos
Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos) he had ascribed to the

Philomela the promotion to the tribunate. Anyhow Momm-
sen's inscription, in addition to what I have here cited, adds
greatly to the weight of the report of Juvenal's exile in Scot-
land.' Grotefend shews that tribuni are commanders of cohortes

milliari-ae, praefecti of ordinary cohortS. The coh. 1 milliaria
Delmatarum (Or. 1833. Murat. 455 1) has a tribune, the or·-
dinary coh. 1 *Delmatarum (Or. 2153. 2716-7, 4082. 4132.
Murat. 812 8) has a praefectus. The inscription will run then:
(Cere)ri sacrum (D. Iu)nius Iuvenalis (praefectus Ἰ) coh(ortis 1)
Delmatarum, 11(vir) quinq(uennalis)‚ flamen divi Vespasiani,
vovit dedicav(itq)ue sua pecunia.
