apparatus Berl. 1851 ; the smaller with Persius and Sul-
picia and select critical notes in Weidmann’s series Berl.
1868). A few tracts by Friedlanden who is employed on
an edition of Martial, are of value; but his Sittenge-

plumps up the meagre list: ‘ein spiiter romischer Satiriker des 4. Jahrh.
